        <h1>Tempests Unleashed: Navigating the Impact of Catastrophic Storms</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p class="catas">Catastrophic storms, including hurricanes, tornadoes, and blizzards, are powerful natural phenomena causing widespread destruction. Fueled by climate change, these storms pose significant challenges, necessitating proactive measures like advanced technology for early detection and efficient emergency response. Beyond immediate impacts, they trigger humanitarian and economic crises, emphasizing the importance of international cooperation, environmental conservation, and community education in building resilience and adapting to the changing climate.</p>
          
<div class="bullet-points">
    <div class="headings">• Hurricanes, Typhoons, and Cyclones:</div>
     <div class="details">Massive tropical storms, such as hurricanes, typhoons, or cyclones, derive their destructive power from warm ocean waters. These storms exhibit a well-defined eye at their center, surrounded by intense wind and rain bands. The havoc they wreak includes powerful winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges, with coastal regions being particularly vulnerable to widespread flooding.</div>
    <div class="details"><p class="mitigation-tech">Mitigation techniques for Hurricanes, Typhoons, and Cyclones:</p><p>• Building Coastal Defenses: Constructing sea walls, levees, and other barriers along coastlines can help reduce the impact of storm surges.</p>
    <p>
        • Wetland Creation and Maintenance: Wetlands act as natural buffers, absorbing excess water and reducing flooding in coastal areas.</p>
        <p>• Zoning Laws: Implementing zoning laws that restrict construction in high-risk areas can help minimize property damage and loss of life.</p></div>

    <div class="headings">• Tornadoes: </div>
    <div class="details">In contrast to the vast scale of hurricanes, tornadoes are violent, rapidly rotating columns of air extending from a thunderstorm to the ground. Despite their smaller size, tornadoes produce extremely high wind speeds, causing localized but severe damage. Striking with minimal warning, they leave communities little time for preparation, leading to the destruction of buildings and infrastructure.</div>
    <div class="details"><p class="mitigation-tech">Mitigation techniques for Tornadoes: </p> 
        <p>• Building Tornado Safe Rooms: Constructing safe rooms in homes and public buildings provides a designated space where individuals can seek shelter during a tornado.</p>
        <p>• Roof and Wall Reinforcement: Reinforcing roofs and walls with materials that can withstand high winds can help prevent structural damage.</p>
        <p>• Windbreaks: Planting trees and shrubs strategically around buildings can reduce wind speed and lessen the impact of tornadoes.</p>

        </div>
    

    <div class="headings">• Blizzards:</div> 
    <div class="details">Intense winter storms known as blizzards bring a combination of strong winds, heavy snowfall, and reduced visibility. These storms can paralyze entire regions, disrupting transportation, closing schools, and impacting businesses. The cold temperatures associated with blizzards also pose risks such as frostbite and hypothermia.</div>
    <div class="details"><p class="mitigation-tech">Mitigation techniques for Blizzards: </p>
        <p>
            • Snow Removal and De-Icing: Regularly removing snow and ice from roads and walkways can prevent accidents and keep transportation routes clear.
    </p>
        <p>
            • Insulation: Properly insulating buildings helps maintain internal temperatures, reducing the risk of frostbite and hypothermia.
        </p>
    <p>
        • Emergency Heating Sources: Having alternative heating sources, such as generators or propane heaters, can ensure warmth during power outages.
